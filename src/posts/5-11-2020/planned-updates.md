<p class="post-paragraph">This website is very simple because it is important for me to just get something online. As these updates are made I’ll scratch them off this list. These aren’t in any particularorder; I’ll work on them as I feel motivated.</p>

<ul class="post-list">
    <li>Light/Dark mode</li>
    <li>GSAP integration for some nice animation</li>
    <li>PrismJS integration so people can highlight code examples</li>
    <li>Tagging so post types can be filtered</li>
    <li>Github pull request links to allow users to submit pull requests easily in case any typos or errors are noticed (an example can be seen on <a href="https://fireship.io">https://fireship.io</a>)</li>
    <li>General UI updates. I’m not quite happy with the look of this site yet. It’s good enough for now, but there’s a lot of room for improvement</li>
    <li>Create a favicon instead of using default Gatsby favicon</li>
    <li>Create a search functionality</li>
    <li>Create a Contact Form (This one really depends on whether there is any demand. I’m currently on the free Netlify plan and unless there’s a good reason to change, I’d like to keep it that way.)</li>
    <li><s>Add a 'read time' metric to posts</s></li>
</ul>
