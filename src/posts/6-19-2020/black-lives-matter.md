<p class="post-paragraph">On May 25th, Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes while Floydbegged for his life, pleading “I can’t breathe”. For the last 3 minutes, Floyd was motionless while Chauvin ignored onlookers’ pleas to check his pulse.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">A series of protests and unrest followed, with over 2000 cities in the U.S. and around the world seeing protests.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">At first, I thought the best thing I could do was remain silent. It felt disrespectful to post on Twitter or this blog at a time of so much suffering. It still does. But after days of reflection, I’ve come to realize that it’s not enough to simply hold myself accountable for any biases I may have. I need to be a vocal advocate.</p>
