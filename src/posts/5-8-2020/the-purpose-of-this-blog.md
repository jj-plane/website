<h1 class="post-header">Intro</h1>

Hello and welcome to my first post. There are two purposes to this blog: to catalog my professional development as a front-end web developer and to create an outlet to express my thoughts on media that I consume

<br />
<h1 class="post-header">Who am I?</h1>

My name is Joshua. I’ve been a professional web developer since 2013. I graduated from Slippery Rock University with a degree in Information Technology. So far, I’ve worked for a couple of great companies including ABG Capital, PNC, and DDI. When I’m not writing javascript, I’m usually spending time with my amazing wife, [Kristina](https://www.kristinaaggas.com/), complaining about my rank in CSGO, or reading.

<br />
<h1 class="post-header">What I hope to accomplish</h1>

While this website will mainly be for my own growth, I also hope to document my insights about javascript in ways that others will find helpful. There are countless tutorials about learning front end web development, but I feel that some writing styles can convey their ideas better than others. If a single post I write helps a single developer who’s struggling with a problem, I’ll be ecstatic.

<br />
<h1 class="post-header">How was this site built?</h1>

This website is a static website that utilizes the Gatsby framework. I choose Gatsby for a very specific reason: performance. Static websites built using Gatsby are [fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-09-13-why-is-gatsby-so-fast/) and speed is critical to keep your audience happy.

<br />
<h1 class="post-header">How can you reach me?</h1>

The best way is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JJAggas) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joshuaaggas/). I’m far more active on Twitter, so that’s the fastest way to get a response. I’ve had help from some amazing developers over the years, and I want to pay it forward by helping out junior developers with code reviews, learning resources, and general career advice. I may not get back to you right away but if you reach out, I’ll do my best to respond.
